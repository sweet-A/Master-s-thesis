ABSTRACT
-----------------
The change-point problem is detecting a location of change-point in data depending on time. In this paper, the empirical likelihood using double quantile is proposed for detecting a change-point in distributions for independent random variables. We expand the constraints of empirical likelihood to the double quantiles. The proposed method demonstrates the better performance in comparison to the traditional nonparametric tests by simulation. The proposed method is robust regardless of whether the observations are from the same distributions.
